            <p class="footer_text">The effectiveness of the Tax-Loss Harvesting strategy to reduce the tax liability of
                the client will depend on the client’s entire tax and investment profile, including purchases and
                dispositions in a client’s (or client’s spouse’s) accounts outside of Wealthfront Advisers and type of
                investments (e.g., taxable or nontaxable) or holding period (e.g., short- term or long-term).Tax loss
                harvesting may generate a higher number of trades due to attempts to capture losses. There is a chance
                that trading attributed to tax loss harvesting may create capital gains and wash sales and could be
                subject to higher transaction costs and market impacts. In addition, tax loss harvesting strategies may
                produce losses, which may not be offset by sufficient gains in the account and may be limited to a
                $3,000 deduction against income. The utilization of losses harvested through the strategy will depend
                upon the recognition of capital gains in the same or a future tax period, and in addition may be subject
                to limitations under applicable tax laws, e.g., if there are insufficient realized gains in the tax
                period, the use of harvested losses may be limited to a $3,000 deduction against income and
                distributions. Losses harvested through the strategy that are not utilized in the tax period when
                recognized (e.g., because of insufficient capital gains and/or significant capital loss carryforwards),
                generally may be carried forward to offset future capital gains, if any.</p>
